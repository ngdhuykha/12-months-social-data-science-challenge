When I studied the online course Introduction to Academic Literacy of Oxford University, I was introduced with the concept of Reflective Learning,
with the learning cycle including four phases: Action -> Evaluate -> Analyse -> Plan -> Action.

Looking back, although I had realized for a long time that I truly want to become a social data scientist, I have make no significant progress towards that aspiration.
Upon reflection, I realized that there were shortcomings with my planning. During my business studies, I was introduced with SMART goal, which posits that effective goals are 
• Specific
• Measurable
• Attainable
• Relevant
• Time-bound

My goals were just SMAR! It lacks one critical component - Time-bound. Without specific deadlines, it is easy to become sidetracked. 
This challenge is thus a resolve to those shortcomings. 

This is the roadmap I created myself, based on the course structure of the referenced courses/programs.

Note to self (some ground rules):
1. Time management is key
2. Consistency is key
3. Show, don't tell
4. Theory matters more than the tools (advice from Justin, thank you)
5. Get things done

Start date: 24/12/2024
End date: 24/12/2025

By Christmas 2025, I will finish this roadmap.
